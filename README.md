# Mini-Projects

These are some of the projects I have done on Kaggle or as a part of some course.

## [1. Bank Costumer Relations](https://github.com/ApurvGude/Mini-Projects/tree/master/BankCustomerPrediction)

Given a dataset of 10000 bank users, used Artificial Neural Networks to predict whether the costumer will stay or leave the bank in the future. Based on the model, were able to figure out what factors played a role in customers leaving the bank. This notebook was made as a part of the Deep Learning Course on Udemy.

## [2. DisasterTweets](https://github.com/ApurvGude/Mini-Projects/tree/master/DisasterTweetsNLP)

Created a model using NLP techniques like TFIDF Vectorizer and Word2Vec embeddings to predict whether a tweet is about a disaster or is it a farce. This was done as part of a Kaggle competition. The prediction model achieved a F1 score of 0.78.

## [3. Predict House Prices](https://github.com/ApurvGude/Mini-Projects/tree/master/Predict%20house%20prices)

Used feature engineering and data wrangling techniques to create a model to predict the price of houses on the market.Based on the analysis, figured out which features of houses matter the most to the buyers.

## [4. Predicting Google Stock Price](https://github.com/ApurvGude/Mini-Projects/tree/master/Predicting%20Google%20Stock%20Price)

Used Time series forecasting techniques such as LSTMs and GRUs to predict the Google Stock Price for the next two days.This notebook was made as a part of Deep Learning Course on Udemy

## [5. Startup Funding](https://github.com/ApurvGude/Mini-Projects/tree/master/Startup_funding)

Given the data of around 3000 indian startups, we created a modle to predict how much funding the startup will receive. Used data cleaning and data exploration to find out which features matter the most. Also used TFIDF Vectorizer to find key words in description of the startup and used those keywords as input for the final training set.

## [6. TMDB Box Office Predictions](https://github.com/ApurvGude/Mini-Projects/tree/master/TMDB%20Box%20office%20predictions)

The goal of this project is to predict what will be the box office earnings given features such as budget, genres,cast,crew, release language and popularity.Using data exploration and data wrangling techniques, we also figured out what factors make a movie successful.Our regression model was able to achieve a RMSLE of 2.21
